# excel-stuff

More or less usefull bits and/or pieces for functions in excel. 
Just one bit for now:
binarysearch:
VBA using binary search to extract numbers that are unique for one column compared with another column.
I.e. If "23" exist in both column B and D, don't add it to column J. If "28" exist only in column B - add to new row in column J.
